# TVShow
Watch movies easier

## What is TVShow?
TVShow is an experimental project which aims to provide a simple interface to watch any movies.

## Well, is it legal?
Depending on which country you live in, it may be not. Also, I'm planning to rethink the media's content to make it entirely legal (ie. content may be replaced by free instructional media such as documentaries or TED podcast)

## Hmm, it does remind me something...
Well, you may be thinking about Popcorn Time, don't you ? If so, yes. The concept is not new, and this project is clearly inspired from it. Also, my primary goal was to make an alternative, using .NET framework.

## What does it use?
I use .NET Framework 4.5 and C# for the backend. WPF/XAML for the interface. Libtorrent-rasterbar for torrent downloading.

## Supported platforms
At this time, only Windows 7+ is supported (Windows 7, 8, 8.1 32/64 Bits). I plan to make it cross-platform using Mono.

## Can I help you?
Of course yes! It's open-source so feel free to submit pull-request, I promise I'll consider them.

## Visual Studio .sln
The solution is built using Visual Studio 2013.
